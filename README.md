# FT_PRINTF

This project was completed in december 2018 as part of the 42 school cursus. The aim was to compile a library containing the functions from our [libft](https://github.com/anaiel/libft) and our own version of the printf function (which can handle cspdiouxXfb conversions, # -+0 flags, hhllhljz modifiers, precision and field width). The full instuctions can be found [here](https://github.com/fpetras/42-subjects/blob/master/ft_printf.en.pdf).

## Getting Started

In the project folder, update the libft library with the following command :
```
git submodule update --remote --merge
```
Then run the `make` command to compile the library.
